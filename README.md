TrailsApp
=========

This is an experimental Rails application.

It is for choosing Meetup topics, but is currently a long way from what it wants to be.

This is an idea I am playing with.

The concept is to come up with a way to encourage group directed learning by voting on *waypoints* (topics) from different *trails* (lists of things to learn/do).

+   Meetup members vote on or highlight points on the trail that are causing difficulty or are of interest

+   The next point on the trail that gets voted on gets a ‘visit’ (review, discussion) at the next meetup

+   App could store documents, notes, comments, resources (e.g. the presentation used to discuss that point on the trail)

+   Example: In the intermediate section (I’m not there yet) a point on the trail is "Use the asset pipeline effectively"
